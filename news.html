                            <p class = newsp style="line-height: 2;">The recent realignment of architecture school deans continues. This afternoon, Amale Andraos announced that she would be stepping down as dean of Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP). Her term will end on December 31, 2021. The news was first announced by Columbia University President Lee C. Bollinger earlier today and confirmed by Andraos in an email that went out to the GSAPP community.

“As of July, I will begin serving as Special Advisor to the President with a particular focus on the work of the Columbia Climate School,” reads Andraos’s statement, “and I look forward to assisting in the building of this once-in-a-lifetime endeavor.

“It has been my greatest honor to serve the GSAPP faculty, students, alumni, and staff over these past years. It is not easy to capture the outstanding intellectual as well as human qualities that I believe render our School special and different: the vibrancy, dedication, passion, imagination, resourcefulness, and creative irreverence that make its ecology sparkle. Thank you all for the thoughtfulness, care, and commitment you have brought to the School over these past years.” Andraos, who is co-founder of WORKac alongside Dan Wood, began teaching at GSAPP in 2011. She accepted the deanship in 2014 and cited the possibility of tackling climate change through the built environment as a major impetus for accepting the posting. It makes sense then, that, in addition to continuing to teach, Andraos will focus her attention on the newly formed Climate School, which brings all of Columbia’s climate research initiatives and climate-focused majors under one umbrella.

Under Andraos’s tenure, GSAPP launched the first PhD program for historic preservation in the U.S., and more recently, the GSAPP Anti-Racism Action Plan (but not without significant prodding by alumni last summer, as much of the country was seized by protests against systemic racism and police brutality).

Columbia will reportedly release more information on the search for an interim dean in the near future, as well as the search committee responsible for naming Andraos’s permanent successor.</p>

                            <p class = newsp style="line-height: 2;">When Columbia granted MD degrees to women for the first time 100 years ago, the historical significance was noted by the New York Times. On Page 14 of the May 29, 1921, edition, the newspaper devoted a full column to the milestone, amid articles about a car accident, a fatal tenement fire, the theft of 17 motor cars, and a reduction in prices on all Buick models.

The headline, “New Columbia Era on Graduation Day,” was followed by language that revealed contemporary references to women: “This year marks a new era in the progress of the fair sex at Columbia University. On June 1, Commencement Day, for the first time in the university's history, the Hippocratic oath will be administered to women with the conferring of degrees on the graduates of the College of Physicians and Surgeons.”

The six women to graduate that day included three women who finished in the top five of the class: Gulli Lindh Muller, who graduated first in the class (the Times article said that meant she received an A in every course in her senior year); Susanna Haigh (No. 3 in the class), and Emma Corwin (No. 5). The other three women to receive MD degrees that year among the class of 117 were Dorothea Curnow, Elizabeth Wright, and May Mayers. Since that June 1, 1921, graduation day, the Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, as it is now known, has graduated more than 3,300 women, including the 82 women in the Class of 2021. This year’s class—like recent classes—is majority women, and the entire enrollment of VP&S has more women than men.

Columbia did not admit women until several years after other schools opened their doors to women. The University of Michigan medical school was the first in the United States to admit women, welcoming its first female student in 1870. Johns Hopkins followed in 1893 and Cornell in 1898. By 1904, 97 of 160 U.S. medical schools admitted women. That percentage grew over the next decade. Gulli Lindh Muller, MD'1921, is credited with opening the medical school's doors to women at Columbia. As a Barnard College senior nearing graduation in 1917, Gulli Lindh (she married during medical school), with the support of Barnard Dean Virginia Gildersleeve, began a campaign to apply to medical school at Columbia, even though she had accepted a spot at Johns Hopkins. Several months later—after an effort that included letter writing, in-person meetings, a challenge to raise money to pay for accommodations for women, and an anonymous check from a Texas gentleman—P&S Dean Samuel Lambert finally agreed to allow women to apply.

Muller and nine other women started medical school in 1917. The six women who graduated four years later represented a little over 5% of the Class of 1921. Although the percentage of women in graduating classes remained small for several decades following the first class, by 2021, the graduating class at VP&S is nearly 53% women.
